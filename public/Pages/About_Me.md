I'm a sophomore at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/), pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science with a minor in music. I like to learn new skills and concepts to develop clever solutions to solve difficult problems. I'm interested in Game Development, 3D graphics (most recently OpenGL), Web Development, and low-level programming.

I have a love for playing Trumpet and making music, mostly in contemporary and jazz settings. I also love talking about and analyzing music used in movies, musicals, and video games. Music and I have a storied history; its an integral part of my identity. Some of my other smaller interests include Drawing/Watercolor painting and graphic design.

I've documented a few of the projects I've worked on [here](/Projects), and you can find my contact info [here](/Contact).
