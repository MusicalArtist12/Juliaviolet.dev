## Design Overview

I wanted to create a website to fulfill a small handful of needs. It needed to display my personality and own abilities as a developer, so using something like *Wix*, *Squarespace*, or the many other website builders was out of the question. That, and I had very little web development experience so I also just wanted to build it myself.

I chose to use Next.JS as my primary framework. I kinda knew that i wanted to use React after doing some preliminary research, and ultimately chose Next.JS because it was recommended to me, I liked how it was designed, and i liked its focus on server-side rendering. 

## Purpose

This website serves 3 primary goals. First and foremost, it gives myself a little home on the wild web. The [/About Me](/About-Me) section gives a place for visitors to learn about who I am, and the [/Contact](/Contact) section gives a place for visitors to find me in other places. The website's design also reflects my personal taste in styling, and when working on my linux config files, i found myself coming back to the design of my website to guide me. 

The next big goal for the website is to organize my projects, give them a goal, and to easily share them. When it comes to my personal projects, I often find it difficult to maintain motivation and seeing the end goal. While I was still putting the website together, I found myself coming up with many project ideas that may have been a bit silly, but would have been a ton of fun to make. A lot of that creative motivation came from just being able to have a place to share it. 

<div className='inset_photo' style={{
        width: "clamp(12rem, 30vw, 30rem)",
        height: "auto"
}}>
    <img src="/ProjectPhotos/bad_website.png"/>
</div>

The last goal was to learn web development. I had experience with html/css (*not a ton but I knew a little*) but lacked any javascript experience, which is part of the reason why I chose react and next.js. It seemed simple enough given what i knew about html so I dived in. 

The photo on the left was from 2019, and I clearly didn't know what a `<div>` was.
